This week, there&#8217;s only 4 days of class for Hack Reactor. Starting from the 23rd, I get holiday break until January 2nd!<!--more-->

On an unrelated note, today was a grueling day for the mind. Inheriting a codebase and attempting to understand and modify it can get frustrating. My partner and I rammed our heads against the wall as we couldn&#8217;t reason about the bug in our program, leading us to question all we thought we once knew. Thankfully, with some help, my partner and I got over the hurdle in our sprint and moved on. I think that I learned today that stubbornness can only be helpful to a certain point. However, on the job, using the resources at hand before reaching out for assistance is a useful and highly important skill (and one I&#8217;m also developing at HR).

As for the holiday break, I&#8217;m definitely not planning on taking a _complete_ break from coding. I think a few hours each day reviewing and practicing using the material will help it settle in for a huge jumpstart once Hack Reactor starts back up after the holidays. I&#8217;m looking forward to receiving my new headset for use in class (my old one broke but this one has been taking _forever_ to arrive), giving gifts, receiving gifts, the whole lot.
