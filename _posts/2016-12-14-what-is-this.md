Today, HRR was an obstacle course of JavaScript fundamentals understanding. The title of this post relates to the keyword &#8216;this&#8217;, which was a topic taught today and is in itself a subject of JS demanding many hours of conceptualizing and practical usage to fully understand. At least I&#8217;m getting started. Among &#8216;this&#8217;, the new-ish material of the day involved learning and relearning concepts regarding scopes and closures.

Regarding the other stuff covered today: there was pair programming, watching video lectures, town hall, watching live lectures, the list goes on and on. It seems like after a long day of Hack Reactor, you just want to sit down, stare at a blank wall, and think about nothing (or perhaps anything but Hack Reactor) until you finally go to bed just to wake up to repeat the process. Or maybe it&#8217;s just me.

Still, keeping busy is better than doing nothing all day, right? I&#8217;ve got my first self-assessment tomorrow, which me luck!
