## My Experience With Ember

Ember is a really interesting front-end JavaScript framework. It's different than the main ones (AngularJS, React, Backbone) in that it's **opinionated**. While developing applications in the Ember ecosystem, developers make use of the ember-cli which generates boilerplate code (including tests!) which sets you up for success. However, it's generally known that the learning curve of Ember is steep.
