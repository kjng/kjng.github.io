Since today was the third day of the data structures sprint and nothing particularly stood out, I thought I would write about the expectations of a prospective student/current student in the program according to Hack Reactor.<!--more-->

This is the shortlist:

> Communication
  
> Interaction
  
> Empathy
  
> Feedback
  
> Group Dynamics
  
> Friction
  
> Building a Community

&nbsp;

The first three, communication, interaction, and empathy are expectations of students in the program which are possibly the most important skills to develop and carry onward even after graduation from the immersive.

I think my weakest points are interaction and empathy. I find that I hold many people I interact with to expectations based on my own personality and mannerisms. It just so happens that the second point, empathy can help with reconciling my expectations with the actual person&#8217;s properties that I&#8217;m interacting with.

With empathy, the steps to understand and share feelings with another individual comes in the form of asking yourself to compare and contrast both of the parties in the interaction and realizing the best way to achieve each other&#8217;s goals together.

Specific to developers, Hack Reactor teaches its students to have empathy for the people you make things for, the people you make things with, and yourself.

I&#8217;m beginning to see a trend of learning life lessons from the immersive as well as the expected coding skills as I&#8217;m nearing the end of my first week.
