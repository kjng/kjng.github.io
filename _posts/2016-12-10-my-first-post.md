This is my first post on my new blog!

I&#8217;m Kevin, and I&#8217;m at the beginning of my journey with Hack Reactor Remote.

Remote is the study-from-home solution from Hack Reactor and allows students to take part in their immersive bootcamp without relocating.

This blog will be my the place where I recount what I did that day in class, sharing my code, and general thoughts I might have while being a part of the HRR program.

It&#8217;s getting late on the East Coast so I&#8217;ll call it for tonight.
