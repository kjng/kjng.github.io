Tomorrow, I'm starting with my first day of theÂ Hack Reactor immersive. I took HR Remote Beta previously so I'm not especially nervous about what to expect learning through the internet and my computer.

The Hack Reactor Immersive is Monday through Saturday 9am-8pm PST. Since I'm on the east coast, however, I start the day at 12pm. This is actually ideal for me since I hate waking up for anything at 9am :).

Here's an intro I wrote to my cohort earlier tonight:

> Hey guys,
>
> My name is Kevin and I currently live in Edison, New Jersey. For the past 2 decades of my life, I've devoted my time to practicing and performing classical piano. Just recently, I graduated from a music conservatory in Boston, MA but decided that teaching and performing music wasn't the lifelong path for me.
>
> I've always been extremely interested in computers and tinkered on my own time but didn't give much thought into pursuing software engineering as a career thinking that I missed the cutoff by not studying towards a computer science degree in college. However, I found Hack Reactor and it gave me a vision that I could be an employed software engineer one day :). I love coding and hope to find a way I can mesh music and software development together.

One thing I'm still deciding is my use of operating system for the program. I've been a lifelong Windows user with minimal time using OSX. Hack Reactor is catered towards the OSX user as is the current web software engineering field. I think I'll stick with Windows for a couple of days to see if I have issues with differing operating system from the average cohort classmate.

I think for future reference, it might be nice to blog a history of my steps to get to this point. Maybe next Sunday? (It's the one day of the week there isn't class)
