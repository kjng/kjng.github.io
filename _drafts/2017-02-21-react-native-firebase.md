## React Native and Firebase

### What is React Native?

React Native is a library built on top of React for building native mobile applications on iOS and Android. It uses the same general syntax of React (for building web apps) but with different components.

For example, when building a web app in React, you would use a div as a container but in React Native, 'View' is used. Even though learning all these new mobile built-in component names requires some time, React Native components quickly become associated to HTML elements in your head.
