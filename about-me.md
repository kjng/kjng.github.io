Hi, I&#8217;m Kevin!

Formerly, I was an aspiring concert pianist but as a result of reality hitting and a declining interest in playing and teaching piano for a career, I turned to my next best option.

It turns out I love coding. I like being the wizard behind the curtain churning out outputs that amaze the user. So I&#8217;d like to make a career out of it and do it for the rest of my life.

Unfortunately, going to college (again) to garner the skills of being a software engineer was not financially feasible or responsible. In addition, the time invested would bring my total duration in college up to 8 years. Therefore, I sought out [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/).

Hack Reactor Remote strongly recommends students blog regularly citing each student&#8217;s blog as a helpful supporting document in the job search. This blog is a place for me to share my journey through [Hack Reactor Remote](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-immersive), an online coding immersive.
